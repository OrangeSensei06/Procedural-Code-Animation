# Procedural-Code-Animation
A curiosity project in which i try to use my code to animate the player by changing the shape with respect to its velocity and acceleration!

# The video of a showcase

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/992986420?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Procedural_animation_test"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>


### I still have to optimize the code and add other functions before uploading the project files! Look forward to it!

- My Goal was to make something animate on its own so i can be lazy and not animate it myself or hire an artist (damn they are costly)
- If you see on Bottom left you can see Song Position and stuff, well trying out rythm game theme! Next Gen OSU Incoming lol!
