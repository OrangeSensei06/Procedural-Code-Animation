# Procedural-Code-Animation
A curiosity project in which i try to use my code to animate the player by changing the shape with respect to its velocity and acceleration!

### I still have to optimize the code and add other functions before uploading the project files! Look forward to it!

- My Goal was to make something animate on its own so i can be lazy and not animate it myself or hire an artist (damn they are costly)
- If you see on Bottom left you can see Song Position and stuff, well trying out rythm game theme! Next Gen OSU Incoming lol!
